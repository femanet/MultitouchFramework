# FIXME

* BoundingBoxFilter should reset the box if the cursor is up

# NEW STUFF

* Swing-based cursor-to-region dispatcher
* JavaFX-based cursor-to-region-dispatcher
* Generic cursor-to-region-dispatcher
* Gesture lock
* Better packaging: Swing, basic gestures, Windows 7 Touch, MacBook trackpad, JavaFX 2, etc.
* Windows Touch events
* MacBook trackpad / magic mouse events
* Mouse/keyboard simulated touch events
* Handle unintended finger up
* Plugin for NASA World Wind?
* Android support?

# THINK ABOUT IT

* Block state ON/OFF/BYPASS
* Decouple Surface / Screen / Canvas
